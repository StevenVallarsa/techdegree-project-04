## Project 04: OOP Game Show App
### Using JavaScript, create an interactive "Hangman"-like phrase guessing game
In this project, you'll create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Youâ€™ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.


#### BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
- The game will chose a random phrase from an array and display the blank letters on the screen.
- The user will select one letter at a time, with successful guesses being displayed on the board, and unsuccessful guesses loosing one of the five provided lives.
- If the player successfully reveals the phrase, they win, if they lose all their lives, they lose.
- The "Start Game" button will load a new game board

#### EXTRA CREDIT

- Let the player use their computer keyboard to select letters instead of clicking the on screen keyboard.
- Change the layout with css
